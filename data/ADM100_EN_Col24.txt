3. In what profile should you change the number of background work processes?
             Choose the correct answers.

              X    A Default profile

              X    B Background profile

              X    C Instance profile

             You are correct! The instance profile is the correct profile in this case, as settings in this
             profile only apply to the affected instance, and the number of work processes for an
             instance is defined here. In the default profile, you maintain parameters that apply to all
             instances or for the entire SAP system. The background profile does not exist. Read more
             about this in the course ADM100, Unit 1, lesson 2.
